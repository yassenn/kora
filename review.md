The project's coding, structure, and dependencies have been checked.

**Mobile App (React Native):**
*   Dependencies installed successfully.
*   Linter passes without any warnings.
*   Tests pass.
*   The mobile app appears to be functional but requires the backend API to be running.

**Backend (PHP):**
*   The backend is a custom PHP application that requires a MySQL database named `kickoff_db`.
*   The database schema is available in `kickoff_db.sql`.
*   Database credentials need to be configured in `backend/config/database.php`.
*   I was unable to verify the PHP syntax because the `php` command is not available in the environment.

To proceed with making the application fully functional, the following steps are needed:
1.  Set up the `kickoff_db` database.
2.  Configure the database credentials in `backend/config/database.php`.
3.  Run a PHP server to host the backend API.
